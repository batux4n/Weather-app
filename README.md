- **Lottie**: Used for animated weather backgrounds.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides the weather data.

## Setup Information

This project uses **React** and **Vite** for fast development and builds.

Vite provides a minimal setup for React with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and **ESLint** integration. You can choose between two official Vite plugins for React:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh, a faster alternative to Babel.
